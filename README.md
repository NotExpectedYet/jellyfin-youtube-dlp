### Jellyfin Docker image with Non-Free librarys and Youtube-DLP installated. 

Builds once a week from jellyfin/jellyfin:unstable

I personally use this on unraid, just swap out `jellyfin/jellyfin:lastest` with `notexpectedyet/jellyfin-custom-youtube-dlp:latest
`

This is mainly for personal use, use at your own risk. Has been my daily driver since creating the repo. 

Provided As is... no warrenty or support given...
